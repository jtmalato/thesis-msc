\subsection{Model M$_0$ derivation} \label{appendix:M0.derivation}

Knowing seronegative individuals become seropositive at rate $\lambda_t$ and seropositive individuals revert at rate $\rho_t$, the proportion of seropositive individuals in a cohort $P$ is defined by the differential equation \cite{yman2016antibody}
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dP}{dt}=\lambda_t (1-P) - \rho_t P\ .
\end{equation}
%
\noindent
Considering model M$_0$, with constant transmission rates, $\lambda_t=\lambda$ and $\rho_t=\rho$, this equation can be solved to estimate the proportion of individuals of age $t$ at each cross-section.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:apendix.2}
\begin{split}
    \int \frac{1}{\lambda(1-P)-\rho P}\ dP =& \int dt \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow \int \frac{1}{\lambda-P(\lambda+\rho)}\ dP =&  \int dt \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow -\frac{1}{\lambda+\rho} \int \frac{-(\lambda+\rho)}{\lambda-P(\lambda+\rho)}\ dP =&  \int dt \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow -\frac{1}{\lambda+\rho} \ln(\lambda-P(\lambda+\rho)) =&\  t+c \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow \  \ln(\lambda-P(\lambda+\rho)) =& -(\lambda+\rho)(t+c) \Leftrightarrow \\
    %\Leftrightarrow \  P(\lambda+\rho) =& \ \lambda - e^{ \left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}} \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow \  P =&\  \frac{\lambda - e^{ \left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho}\ .
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Since a true seropositive state could only be achieved by being exposed to the malaria parasites (not accounting for the maternal acquired antibodies), this model assumes that no individual is seropositive at the moment of birth, i.e. $P(0)=0$, thus
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \frac{\lambda - e^{ \left\{-(\lambda+\rho)0-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho} = &\  0 \Leftrightarrow \\
    \frac{\lambda - e^{ \left\{-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho} = &\  0 \Leftrightarrow \\
    %\Leftrightarrow \frac{e^{ \left\{-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho} = &\  \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\rho} \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow e^{ \left\{-(\lambda+\rho)c\right\}} =& \ \lambda \Leftrightarrow \\
    %\Leftrightarrow -(\lambda+\rho)c =& \ \ln(\lambda) \Leftrightarrow \\
    \Leftrightarrow c =& -\frac{\ln(\lambda)}{\lambda+\rho}\ ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent
that can be directly applied onto previous equation (\ref{eq:apendix.2}),
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    %P =&\  \frac{\lambda - e^{ \left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t+(\lambda+\rho)\frac{\ln(\lambda)}{\lambda+\rho}\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho} \\
    P =&\  \frac{\lambda - e^{ \left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t+\ln(\lambda)\right\}}}{\lambda+\rho} \\
    =&\ \frac{\lambda-e^{\left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t \right\}}\lambda}{\lambda+\rho} \\
    =& \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\rho}\left(1- e^{\left\{ -(\lambda+\rho)t \right\}}\right)\ .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
